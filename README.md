# Go Restful API Boilerplate

Easily extendible RESTful API boilerplate aiming to follow idiomatic go and best practice.

The goal of this boiler is to have a solid and structured foundation to build upon on.

- Structured logging with [Logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus)
- Routing with [chi router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi) and middleware
- JWT Authentication using [jwt-go](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go) with example passwordless email authentication
